# Outline

## Model donors as Gaussian LO

- Fig 1a: Distributions of donor efficacies
- 1b: Show drawing from that distribution, getting yes/no, counting up
- 1c: What is the critical σ to detect with FFH @ 80% power?

## Model donors as good/bad

- Fig 2: Show distribution
- 2b: Same as 1b?
- 2c: Same table

## Good/bad donors with microbiome

- 3a: Same as 2a
- 3b: Assign good/bad to random 16S's, simulate, test for separation
- 3c: Same as 2c; with diarrhea, critical Δp
- 3d: Same as 3c; with weak m.b. signal (IBD?)

## Biomarker

- 3a: Donors have some mean values, drawn from donor envelope
- 3b: Patients have values drawn from envelopes around each donor
- 3c: Table of values; looking for critical σ_donor / σ_patient

Look in lit for σ_patient across IBD patients. Look at σ_donor as saying a
strong drug's effect?
