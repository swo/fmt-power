# Power calculations for detecting differences in efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation donors

## Getting started

Dependencies:

- \*nix environment (for the downloading and extracting commands to work)
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (not essential, but removes the requirement to run scripts in order by hand)
- R (developed against 3.6.0), including packages:
    - [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)
    - [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html)
    - [memoise](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/memoise/index.html) (again, not strictly essential, but made development much faster)
